# Price-prediction-using-Regression
Predicting the price of the housing data set using Regression

Building a simple Linear Regression model to predict the prices of the houses in the United States

To predict the response following steps are adopted:

1.  Uploading the required data set in Python

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data set

3.  Data Pre-processing and cleaning

4.  Removing Outliers in the data

5.  Checking for Multicollinearity in the features

6.  Building and Training Regression model

7.  Evaluating the assumptions of the algorithm

8.  Evaluating the results
